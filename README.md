FULPRAY 

Inspired by FPT Pray, FulPray is a place where students of Fulbright University Vietnam can come and place their wishes. No particular miracle is guaranteed, but sometimes all we need is an illusion of being guarded and taken care of by the gods. 

Will likely to not update or change or be maintained within the next three months because although the current animations and stuffs are kinda jagged & not professional, it gets the job done, and I have four math classes to survive.
