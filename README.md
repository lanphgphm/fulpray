# FULPRAY - ĐÌNH PHƯƠNG MAI 

Inspired by FPT Pray, FulPray is a place where students of Fulbright University Vietnam can come and place their wishes. No particular miracle is guaranteed, but sometimes all we need is an illusion of being guarded and taken care of by the gods. 

Full idea credit to https://fptpray.com/ nand its author. This project is made overnight for fun and for my own learning purpose. Vietnamese name given by chị Nga My.
